                <h3>The person who's going to ask the "Why"</h3>
                <p>Jimi is an user enthusiast, who has a passion in storytelling and connecting with individuals from all walks of life. Originally from a physiology/neuroscience background, he diverted the dental school route to a more heart-fulfilling path in the startup culture.</p>
                <p>He's currently enrolled at SIB in the web design track with a huge appetite to learn and experiment not only in the UX/UI but the front-end development as well.</p>
                <p>He strives to be a beautiful unicorn (designer|developer) someday~ </p>
